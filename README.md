# RenderingEngine
My C++ render engine

# Build
You can use CLion or Visual Studio with Ninja for building

* Clone the repository: ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/Arimekiku/RenderingEngine```
* Make sure you use Ninja generator
* Hit ```F5 (Build button)``` and wait

There's 320 building steps and pretty big libraries so building may take some time
